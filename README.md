Hi! My name is Emily Rodriguez! I have a background in Web Development and Technical Writing and I am interested in transitioning into the field of data analytics.

My journey in web development has instilled a deep appreciation for the power of data. From crafting user-friendly web applications to managing information systems, I've consistently used my technical skills to extract meaning from data and translate it into actionable solutions. This fascination with data analysis, coupled with my strong analytical mindset and communication skills, has fueled my passion to transition into a data analyst role.

My experience analyzing website traffic, user behavior, and database information through tools like SQL and Google Analytics has ignited my desire to delve deeper into the world of data. I'm eager to leverage my existing technical foundation (including Python and data visualization) to contribute to data-driven decision making and uncover valuable insights across different industries.

With a strong foundation in project management, collaboration, and documentation, I'm confident I can seamlessly integrate into a data team and effectively communicate complex data findings to various stakeholders. I'm a highly motivated individual with an active secret clearance, and I'm eager to put my skills and dedication to work in a fast-paced and dynamic environment.
